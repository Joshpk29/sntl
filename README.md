Use sentiment analysis and twitter topics,
One last project before Junior year let's go

# Overview

This App is designed using dart and flutter. The twitter API allows users to comb through
Tweets based on certain parameters and then returns those tweets. I used a query along with language
to get all english tweets that have the users search term, then utilized a flutter sentiment analysis tool.
this tool assigns values to each word in the selected tweets and sums them up to give a overall score of how possitive the tweet is,
Using this method I am attempting to crow source public opinions about certain topics and give it a numerical value.
